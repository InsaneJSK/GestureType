You are given a context for which you have to provide the absolute next word after the context. Tell the 10 most suitable words which can each be used individually as the next word. Those words may or may not be related to each other as we would only ever choose one of them as the next word of our context. Give the follow-up options as a JSON. Ensure the grammatical correctness and relevance of the words. Give the options so that the context + any one of the word should result in a sentence that may or may not be complete but in case of incompleteness, it should have room to add more words but still make sense when new words are added.
